			 Ub Initial Guess = 0.427615 (Feasible)
			 Use Lb Directly (Lb, Ub) = (0.272690,0.427615)
			 (Lb, Ub) = (0.272690, 0.427615)
			 (Lb, Ub) = (0.272690, 0.350153)
			 (Lb, Ub) = (0.272690, 0.311422)
			 (Lb, Ub) = (0.272690, 0.292056)
			 (Lb, Ub) = (0.282373, 0.292056)
			 (Lb, Ub)(Terminated) = (0.282373, 0.287215)
